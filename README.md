# Chartmetric take home assignment

I chose Option 2 & built a simple RESTful API server.
The API serves content directly from the provided CSV data file, parsing some of the fields to allow better introspection.

## Usage

First, install dependencies: `npm i`
Then you can run the server using `npm start`
Alternatively, if you want to leave it running & automatically rebuild & restart the server on file changes, use `npm run dev`.

## Submission

I've included NOTES.md in this repo where I wrote some notes tracking my time & process as I worked.
Additionally, I've added a picture of my dog, laiko.jpg as my "picture of your favorite anything".
